Small project from Traversy Media Vanilla JS course. Was great to get practice using the Canvas Web API. I have a little bit of experience with Canvas in Python, but this was a great refresher. 

The first portion of the project I treated as a tutorial because math is hard and stuff. I then enjoyed spending a couple hours figuring out how to use the color input to change the colors of the clock, and use the .toDataURL() method to save the Canvas as an image. Also got a nice refresher working with LocalStorage API. 

Overall, a fun little project. I'm furthering my understanding of APIs, and that is very exciting. I feel like I'm starting to catch a glimpse of how all this web stuff works.
